Hi, I'm Aspirant Zhang (张立志), a web developer from China.

- Coding is writing the story of life.
- My dream is to use computer technology to build a better world.
- My current focus at work is on building systems to drive enterprise digitalization.
- As a programmer, I lean towards back-end development and currently focus on PHP.
- I have some experience with React and Typescript and am currently learning Java.
